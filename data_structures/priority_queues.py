"""
It's a regular queue data structure, along with an additional field for priority of a node.
Priority queue can be implemented using heaps.

Applications of priority queues include:
1. Dijkastra shortest path
2. Prim's algorithm
3. Scanning through a large collection for reporting purpose: top n items, with their statistics
4. Any producer consumer situation, where the priority is set based on various conditions.
5. Huffman Coding.

Python's heapq package provies a priority queue implementation. It's basically a binary min-heap on top of a list.
